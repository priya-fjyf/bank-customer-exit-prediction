# 🎯 Customer Points Classification using ML 🧮

## 📌 Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict the **Points Earned** category (Low, Medium, High) by customers based on their profile and activity. It is a **multiclass classification** problem designed to help businesses identify and reward high-engagement customers.

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset includes a variety of customer-related attributes:

- 👤 Customer ID  
- 📈 Credit Score  
- 🌍 Geography (Country/Region)  
- 🧑 Gender  
- 💳 Number of Transactions  
- 💰 Average Monthly Balance  
- 🏦 Account Type  
- ⌛ Tenure (Years with the bank)  
- 📊 Estimated Salary  
- 🔁 IsActiveMember  
- 🎯 **Target**: Points Earned  
  - Categories: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`

## 🤖 ML Algorithms Used

- 📈 Logistic Regression  
- 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier  
- 🌲 Random Forest Classifier  
- 🔍 Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- 💡 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 🔁 Naive Bayes (for comparison)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- 🐍 Python  
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy  
- 📉 Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn  
- 🧼 LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

## 🔍 Data Processing

- Missing value treatment  
- Categorical encoding  
- Feature scaling  
- Train-test split

## 📈 Model Evaluation

- ✅ Accuracy Score  
- 🧮 Confusion Matrix  
- 📉 Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- 📊 Cross-validation (if used)

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a predictive system that classifies customers into **Points Earned** categories, enabling targeted offers, personalized rewards, and customer segmentation for loyalty programs.
